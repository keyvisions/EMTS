# Chapter 2: Polar Representation and Its Implications

Mapping mass and energy in the complex plane broadens our perspective on physical reality. Consider a point $z$ expressed in polar form:

$$
z = r(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)
$$

$r$ is the modulus (magnitude) and $\theta$ is the argument (phase angle). To connect this mathematical structure to physical reality, we can assign physical meaning to $r$ and $\theta$.

### Physical Interpretation of $r$ and $\theta$

To unify the physical dimensions of mass and energy in the complex plane, we introduce appropriate constants to ensure dimensional consistency:

- Let the **real axis** represent mass ($m$), and the **imaginary axis** represent energy ($E$).
- To compare or combine these quantities, we use the speed of light $c$ as a conversion factor, since $E = mc^2$.

#### Modulus $r$ (Unified Magnitude)

The modulus $r$ can be written as:
$$
r = \sqrt{(mc^2)^2 + E^2}
$$
Here, both terms are in units of energy (joules). Alternatively, if you prefer mass units:
$$
r = \sqrt{m^2 + \left(\frac{E}{c^2}\right)^2}
$$

This formulation shows that $r$ represents a generalized "distance" in the mass-energy plane, with $c$ providing the necessary unit conversion.

#### Argument $\theta$ (Unified Phase)

The argument $\theta$ is given by:
$$
\theta = \arctan\left(\frac{E}{mc^2}\right)
$$
This angle quantifies the relative contribution of energy and mass to the physical state represented by $z$.

#### Connecting to Space and Time

- **Modulus $r$ as Space (meters):**  
  If mass is measured in kilograms (kg) and energy in joules (J), we can use the speed of light $c$ to relate these to spatial units. For example, using Planck's constant $h$ and $c$, we can relate energy and mass to spatial scales, as in the Compton wavelength:
  $$
  \lambda = \frac{h}{mc}
  $$

- **Argument $\theta$ as Time (seconds):**  
  The argument can be interpreted as time if we consider angular frequency $\omega$ (in radians per second), where $\theta = \omega t$. Here, Planck's constant $h$ (or reduced Planck's constant $\hbar$) connects energy and frequency:
  $$
  E = \hbar \omega
  $$
  Thus, $\theta$ increases linearly with time, and its value can be related to seconds through the angular frequency $\omega$.

  Additionally, $\omega$ can be interpreted as relating to the likelihood or "density" of a state. If we consider the projection of $z$ onto the real axis as the realization of a physical state, then a higher frequency (larger $\omega$) implies a greater probability for that state to occur. In this framework, $\omega$ serves as an indicator of how frequently or densely a particular state (represented by $z$) is manifested in physical realityâ€”the greater the frequency, the higher the probability or density of occurrence.

By leveraging these physical constants:

- The **speed of light $c$** bridges mass, energy, and space.
- **Planck's constant $h$** (or $\hbar$) connects energy, frequency, and time.

This approach allows us to reinterpret the modulus $r$ as a spatial quantity (meters) and the argument $\theta$ as a temporal quantity (seconds), embedding the fundamental constants of nature directly into our complex plane framework. In this way, the complex number $z$ becomes a unified representation of energy, mass, space, and time, with the constants $c$ and $h$ providing the necessary conversion factors between physical units.

The projection of $z$ on the real axis $m_z$ as a function of $\theta$, i.e., $r = m_z / cos(\theta)$, tells us that at different moments in time $m_z$ appears the same to us yet its $E_z$ changes.
