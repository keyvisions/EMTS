# Chapter 2: Polar Representation and Its Implications

Mapping mass and energy in the complex plane broadens our perspective on physical reality. Consider a point $z$ expressed in polar form:

$$
z = r(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)
$$

$r$ is the modulus (magnitude) and $\theta$ is the argument (phase angle). To connect this mathematical structure to physical reality, we can assign physical meaning to $r$ and $\theta$.

### Physical Interpretation of $r$ and $\theta$

To unify the physical dimensions of mass and energy in the complex plane, we introduce appropriate constants to ensure dimensional consistency:

- Let the **real axis** represent mass ($m$), and the **imaginary axis** represent energy ($E$).
- To compare or combine these quantities, we use the speed of light $c$ as a conversion factor, since $E = mc^2$.

#### Modulus $r$ (Unified Magnitude)

The modulus $r$ can be written as:

$$
r = \sqrt{(mc^2)^2 + E^2}
$$

Here, both terms are in units of energy (joules). Alternatively, if you prefer mass units:

$$
r = \sqrt{m^2 + \left(\frac{E}{c^2}\right)^2}
$$

This formulation shows that $r$ represents a generalized "distance" or "space" in the mass-energy plane, with $c$ providing the necessary unit conversion.

#### Argument $\theta$ (Unified Phase)

The argument $\theta$ is given by:

$$
\theta = \arctan\left(\frac{E}{mc^2}\right)
$$

This angle quantifies the relative contribution of energy and mass to the physical state represented by $z$.

#### Connecting to Space and Time

- **Modulus $r$ as Space (meters):**  
  If mass is measured in kilograms (kg) and energy in joules (J), we can use the speed of light $c$ to relate these to spatial units. For example, using Planck's constant $h$ and $c$, we can relate energy and mass to spatial scales, as in the Compton wavelength:

$$
\lambda = \frac{h}{mc}
$$

- **Argument $\theta$ as Time (seconds):**  
  The argument can be interpreted as time if we consider angular frequency $\omega$ (in radians per second), where $\theta = \omega t$. Here, Planck's constant $h$ (or reduced Planck's constant $\hbar$) connects energy and frequency:
  
$$
E = \hbar \omega
$$
  
  Thus, $\theta$ increases linearly with time, and its value can be related to seconds through the angular frequency $\omega$.

  Additionally, $\omega$ can be interpreted as relating to the likelihood or "density" of a state. If we consider the projection of $z$ onto the real axis as the realization of a physical state, then a higher frequency (larger $\omega$) implies a greater probability for that state to occur. In this framework, $\omega$ serves as an indicator of how frequently or densely a particular state (represented by $z$) is manifested in physical reality—the greater the frequency, the higher the probability or density of occurrence.

---

By leveraging these physical constants:

- The **speed of light $c$** bridges mass, energy, and space.
- **Planck's constant $h$** (or $\hbar$) connects energy, frequency, and time.

This approach allows us to reinterpret the modulus $r$ as a spatial quantity (meters) and the argument $\theta$ as a temporal quantity (seconds), embedding the fundamental constants of nature directly into our complex plane framework. In this way, the complex number $z$ becomes a unified representation of energy, mass, space, and time, with the constants $c$ and $h$ providing the necessary conversion factors between physical units.

The projection of $z$ on the real axis $m_z$ as a function of $\theta$, i.e., $r = m_z / \cos(\theta)$, tells us that at different moments in time $m_z$ appears the same to us yet its $E_z$ changes.

### Projection as Measurement: An Analogy to Wavefunction Collapse

Interpreting $z = r(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)$ as a two-component “state,” the real and imaginary parts act like amplitudes for two mutually exclusive outcomes. Projecting onto the real axis selects the “mass-like” component:
$$
m_z = \mathrm{Re}(z) = r\cos\theta.
$$

If we form a unit vector (ignoring the overall scale $r$):
$$
\lvert \psi \rangle = \cos\theta\,\lvert m \rangle + i\sin\theta\,\lvert E \rangle,
$$
then a measurement “in the mass basis” corresponds to the projector $P_m = \lvert m\rangle\langle m \rvert$. The Born rule gives
$$
\mathbb{P}(m) = \lvert \langle m \lvert \psi \rangle \rvert^2 = \cos^2\theta,
$$
and upon obtaining the mass outcome, the post-measurement state collapses to $\lvert m \rangle$ (the imaginary component is discarded), mirroring
$$
\lvert \psi \rangle \xrightarrow{\text{measure } m} \frac{P_m \lvert \psi \rangle}{\sqrt{\langle \psi \rvert P_m \lvert \psi \rangle}} = \lvert m \rangle,
\qquad
z \xrightarrow{\text{project}} \mathrm{Re}(z) = r\cos\theta.
$$

With $\theta = \omega t$, the probabilities oscillate in time, $\mathbb{P}(m) = \cos^2(\omega t)$, while a measurement at time $t_0$ “freezes” the state on the real axis (idempotency $P_m^2 = P_m$ captures the idea that repeating the same measurement immediately yields the same outcome).

Notes and perspective:
- This is an analogy: a true quantum measurement uses Hermitian operators on a Hilbert space; taking the real part is a geometric projection, not a physical observable per se.
- We deliberately start from a minimal two-dimensional complex state as a common, simple ground; the working thesis is that complexity is layered simplicity. Richer state spaces (higher-dimensional Hilbert spaces, interactions) can be added atop this scaffold.
- Empirical adequacy remains the criterion: any mapping from complex-plane projections to measurements should reproduce standard quantum predictions where applicable.
