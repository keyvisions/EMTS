# The Complex Fabric of Reality

This ongoing work takes a speculative journey into how **E**nergy, **M**ass, **T**ime, and **S**pace might be interconnected through the complex plane, offering a framework for understanding reality.

Figure 1: $m_z$ is what we perceive at time $\theta_0$ and space $r_0$.

## Working Conjecture
Space and time are each single-dimensional continua with (effectively) unbounded resolution. In this model, the modulus $r$ encodes “space” and the argument $\theta$ encodes “time”; observed discreteness arises from projection/measurement, not underlying granularity. Chapters 2–4 explore how $r$ and $\theta$ map to observables and how quadrant-dependent behavior may manifest as force channels. Figure 1 suggests that reality is the collapse of infinite $z$s or space/time combinations.
