# Chapter 5: Standard Model (TODO: Explore quantum implications)

In quantum theory, the wave function describes the state of a particle and encodes information about its position and momentum. The square of the wave function's amplitude is interpreted as a probability density, indicating the likelihood of finding a particle in a particular state or location. In our model, the frequency of oscillation can be linked to this probability density. Higher frequencies may correspond to greater probabilities, suggesting that as the oscillations become more rapid, the likelihood of detecting a particle in a given state increases.

This relationship between frequency and probability density can also be visualized in terms of energy levels. In quantum systems, particles occupy discrete energy levels, and transitions between these levels can be represented by changes in frequency. The density of states, which describes how many states are available at a given energy level, can be influenced by the oscillatory nature of the wave function. Thus, the frequency derived from our polar representation not only encapsulates the passage of time but also serves as a bridge to understanding the probabilistic nature of mass and energy in the quantum realm.
