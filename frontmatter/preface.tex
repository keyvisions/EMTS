In scientific discovery, pure mathematics often serves as the bedrock of our understanding of the universe. This essay is my attempt to develop, in real time with AI, an idea that has echoed in my mind for years. It is a perspective, not a declaration, and simply asks, \emph{what if?}

\begin{quote}
Don't think it doesn't make sense; ask yourself what sense it could have.

First, a mathematical framework is defined that ties Energy, Mass, Time and Space (\EMTS), then speculates how the framework could fit with our knowledge.

Giancarlo Trevisan

\emph{Visualize then Realize!}
