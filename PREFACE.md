# Preface

In scientific discovery, pure mathematics often serves as the bedrock of our understanding of the universe. This project is my first attempt to develop, in real time with AI, an idea that has echoed in my mind for years. It is a perspective, not a declaration, and simply asks, *what if?* This approach is based on the following mantra:

> Don't think it doesn't make sense; ask yourself what sense it could have.
> — *myself*
